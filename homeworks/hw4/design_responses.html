						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there's been legal action to establish accessibility standards on the web, which is neat! For example, there've been federal lawsuits filed against allegedly inaccessible websites. Organizations have also succeeded in establishing some accessibility standards like Section 508 (which requires federal agencies and those under them to have accessible websites) and W3C (which established best practices for web accessibility). </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed looking at the statistics they provided! I think it does a good job of putting into perspective just why accessibility is so important. Since disabilities like color vision deficiencies lean towards the invisible side of the disability spectrum, where people tend not to notice that others have it, I think it's especially important that we're able to contextualize the unique issues these users face. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

						</li>
