                            <p> This article largely focused on the importance of animations in UI. They help to create a smoother, more visually appealing experience for the user. They can also help establish a branding identity in the shapes we use. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite animation was the landing page concept. The visual branding is very cohesive and uses a mixture of colors and shapes without making it overwhelming. The animation is also subtly used in a way that makes the experience feel smoother without detracting from the flow of tasks. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> At first glance, the Awesomed landing page concept looks very simple. It utilizes flat colors and shapes and simple fade=in/fade-out animations. However, the subtleness of the details in the design come together to make up a visually appealing, efficient experience for the user. The animation adds some life as the user scrolls without distracting them from the main content on the page, and there's a simple bar of progress that animates along with the content so the user is aware of how far they are on the page. </p>
