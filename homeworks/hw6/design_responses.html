						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The ideal time for animation is between 200 and 500 ms. 200 ms is ideal for hover effects, fading, and scaling. 300-500 ms is ideal for large moves and complex easing. The size of mobile devices affects these speeds: on smaller devices, the duration should be about 30% shorter, while on larger devices, the duration should be about 30% longer. New elements in lists should appear in about 25 to 30 ms.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the demonstration animations the best. They're great for breaking up the article into digestible chunks. They're also a great way to make the concepts understandable, since design concepts can be pretty hard to understand without seeing them in practice. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "But do not forget that animation is more of an art than science..." </p>
						</li>
